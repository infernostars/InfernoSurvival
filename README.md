# Not Awesome Survival
An MCGalaxy plugin I coded to see how far I could get with my own take on survival. I no longer actively develop it.

## Installation
In order to run a server with NAS, it is **heavily recommended** that you start with a completely fresh [MCGalaxy download.](https://github.com/UnknownShadow200/MCGalaxy)
This is because NAS has a bunch of custom blocks and configuration that **WILL OVERWRITE** what you had before.

You will also need to use the "infid" version of MCGalaxy_.dll which allows for 767 blocks, which can be found [here.](https://github.com/UnknownShadow200/MCGalaxy/tree/master/Uploads)

To install:
1. Run your server once to generate the folders, if you haven't already.
2. Shut down your server.
3. Extract the contents of *plugin.zip* into the *plugins* folder.
4. Run your server again. NAS will generate a starting world, then do one final restart automatically.

If this works without any errors, you're done!

## Tips
It is very difficult to properly undo theft and grief in NAS. Therefore, the server is automatically set to whitelist-only by default.
To allow you and your friends to play, add players to the whitelist with **/whitelist add [playername]+**

**What has been implemented:**
* Gathering limited blocks to build and craft with
* Crafting
* Tools
* Containers to store blocks and tools
* Custom gen and infinite maps (every world is a large "chunk")
* Custom block physics
* Health, fall damage, suffocation, death, and food.

**What has -not- been implemented, and probably never will be unless someone else steps in.**
* Actual pvp
* Mobs
* A bunch of other stuff probably
Please don't bug me for new features.

**Known issues (with unknown causes):**
* Rarely, storage containers will get erased.
* Rarely, the map data will get erased (no more cave fog...)

**Unknown issues:**
* Probably a lot of things.
